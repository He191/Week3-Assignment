# Week3-Assignment
<!-- ðŸŽ¯ Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
ðŸŽ¯ Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
ðŸŽ¯ Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
ðŸŽ¯ Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
ðŸŽ¯ Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

Fetch API
I used Fetch to read data from API

FOR loop
I used For loop to iterate through all the information received from API

DOM
I used DOM objects and methods to dynamically create and update the values in the HTML tags

Event Listner
I created Click based event listeners on dynamic buttons created based on info received from API. The event listner function will update the cookie calculations based on game rules.

SetInterval
I used set interval timer functionality to execute cookie incrementer function every second.

Local storage
I used local storage to save game progress for all important variables and retrieve them when necessary.
